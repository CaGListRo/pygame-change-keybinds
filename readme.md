Key Bindings Test Application
This project is a simple Pygame-based application designed to test the mechanics of key bindings. It allows you to configure and test different key bindings, which will later be integrated into a more comprehensive game.

Features
Key Binding Configuration: Customize the key bindings for "Steer up", "Steer down", "Steer left", and "Steer right" in this case.

Interactive UI: Simple graphical interface to display and test key bindings.

Real-Time Feedback: The application provides immediate feedback when specific keys are pressed.

How to Run
Install Pygame: Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed. You can install Pygame using pip:
pip install pygame

Run the Application:
python main.py

Testing Key Bindings:

The application will display various actions and their associated key bindings.
You can press the corresponding keys to see the immediate effects in the application.
"Steer up" and "Steer down" will move the rectangle up and down.
"Steer left" and "Steer right" will move the rectangle left and right.

Purpose
This application is a utility to ensure that the key binding mechanics work as expected before integrating them into a full-fledged game.

Future Integration
The tested mechanics from this application will be integrated into a larger game project, where they will be used for player movement, actions, and other interactive elements.
